Explanation:
Price Sources:

These are external systems or services providing the latest prices for stocks, mutual funds, etc. They update every 10 minutes or as frequently as possible.
Price Update Service:

This service aggregates and processes the incoming price data from various sources. It ensures that the latest prices are available for portfolio calculations.
The service updates prices every 10 minutes and pushes the new data to the Portfolio Calculation Service.
Portfolio Calculation Service:

This service calculates the current value of each user's portfolio based on the latest price data.
It ensures that the portfolio values are accurate and up-to-date, incorporating the latest prices from the Price Update Service.
Portfolio Database:

This is a central database where user portfolios are stored. Each portfolio contains user information, assets, and their corresponding values.
The database is optimized for quick read and write operations to handle real-time updates and user queries.
Real-Time Update Service:

This service pushes real-time updates to the users. It can use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to provide instant updates as soon as the portfolio values are recalculated.
It ensures that users see their updated portfolio values in real-time.
User Interface (Web/Mobile):

The front-end applications (web and mobile) where users log in to view their portfolios.
The interface is designed to be interactive and responsive, displaying real-time data pushed by the Real-Time Update Service.
User Authentication Service:

This service handles user authentication, managing login, sessions, and user permissions.
It ensures that only authenticated users can access their portfolios.
Data Flow:
Price Update:

Price sources provide updated prices every 10 minutes.
The Price Update Service aggregates and processes these updates.
Portfolio Calculation:

The Portfolio Calculation Service recalculates user portfolio values using the latest price data.
Updated portfolio values are stored in the Portfolio Database.
Real-Time Update:

The Real-Time Update Service pushes the new portfolio values to the user interfaces as soon as they are available.
User Interaction:

Users log in through the User Authentication Service.
Authenticated users can view their real-time portfolios on the web or mobile interface.
Scalability and Reliability Considerations:
Scalability:

Use distributed systems and cloud services to handle increasing numbers of users and data.
Implement load balancing and auto-scaling features to ensure the platform can handle high traffic and data loads.
Reliability:

Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability.
Use robust data storage solutions with regular backups to prevent data loss.
Monitor system performance and health using dedicated monitoring tools to quickly identify and address issues.
This design ensures that the platform can reliably and efficiently manage user portfolios, providing real-time updates and scaling to accommodate growth.
